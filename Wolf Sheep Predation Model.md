What should be written in the introduction:

- What is the aim of this model
	- We aim to illustrate a more dynamic model
		- New agents are created and die in each iteration
		- Deeper level of definition for the micro interactions between agents
- What is the model about
	- The model aims to capture the dynamics in a simple ecosystem with two species, predator and prey. This model is inspired in the work Vito Volterra and Alfred Lotka.
	- This notebook is a simple implementation of the Lotka-Volterra model, which is a system of first-order, non-linear differential equations frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The model was proposed independently by Alfred Lotka in 1925 and Vito Volterra in 1926. The model describes the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The model's equations are given by:
