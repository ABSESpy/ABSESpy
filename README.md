`ABSESpy` makes it easier to build artificial **[Social-ecological systems](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/docs/about/)** with real **GeoSpatial datasets** and fully incorporate **human behaviour**.

## Why `ABSESpy`?

**Several characteristics of Agent-Based model (ABM) make it an essential method for social-ecological systems (SES) research:**

1. It focuses on the change of an SES over time from mutual adaptations of agents and their environments.
2. its ability to generate emergent system-level outcomes from micro-level interactions and macro-level feedback.
3. its ability to represent the diversity and heterogeneity of human and non-human actors and the spatial characteristics of an SES ...

However, there is currently no modelling framework that **combines geo-spatial data and actor behaviour** (`actor` is the term for agents in the SES framework) well. `ABSESpy` is designed for spatial modelling that **couples human and nature** by:

- Modelling environment for agents with **[geo data](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/nature/geodata/)**: `Shapefile`, `GeoTiff`, `NetCDF`.
- Modelling **[human behaviour](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/human/CCR_example/)** of agents with [cognition, contagion and responses](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/docs/background/#human-behaviour-framework).
- Easily manage all [parameters, arguments](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/parameters/), and variables with a `yaml` settings file.

## Install

Install with pip or your favourite PyPI package manager.
```
pip install abses
```

## Basic usage & Documents

You can see how to use `ABSESpy` in these simple [tutorials](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/user_guide/):

1. [Organize an Agent-based model](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/model/) and [easily manage parameters](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/parameters/).
2. Using [geo-spatial data](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/nature/geodata/) as the environment.
3. Simply applying a [human behavior framework](https://songshgeo.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/human/CCR_example/).
