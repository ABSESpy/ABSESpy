!!! Warning

    This is a finished model with a in-production paper. Once the paper is accepted, source codes would be fully released. Please [contact the author] for any related inquiries.

## Overview

This project constructs an agent-based model that simulates agricultural irrigation in the Yellow River Basin.
It considers agent adaptability through a public goods game framework, simulates interactions between irrigating agents and their environment, identifies the main driving mechanisms behind changes in agricultural irrigation water use.

Here is the overall workflow of the model:

## Result glance

The simulation results reproduce the unified water quota policies significantly curbed surface water extraction in the Yellow River Basin. The main bodies of irrigation over-quota surface water extraction are concentrated in provinces such as Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Shandong, which have relatively accurate simulation capabilities.
