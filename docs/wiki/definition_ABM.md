# **What is Agent-based Modeling?**

Agent-based models (ABMs) in the context of GIScience are dynamic models that simulate how individuals make decisions based on their interactions with others and the space around them. The term “agent-based” has typically been used in the social sciences when such models are developed to represent individual people, while the term ``individual-based`` was adopted by ecologists and biologists when developing such models to emulate the behaviors of other organisms such as birds, fish, and mammals (hereafter we refer to all such models as “agent-based”). A distinctive feature of ABMs in GIScience and related disciplines is that the models are inherently spatial, as agents exist at some location in space at every moment in time, and can obtain information from their location and the locations around them to make decisions about what to do or where to move.

在地理信息科学（GIScience）的背景下，基于代理的模型（ABMs）是动态模型，模拟个体如何根据与他人和周围空间的互动来做出决策。当这样的模型被开发用来表示单个人时，“基于代理”的术语通常在社会科学中使用，而生态学家和生物学家在开发此类模型以仿真其他生物（如鸟类、鱼类和哺乳动物）的行为时，则采用了“基于个体”的术语（以下我们将所有这些模型统称为“基于代理”）。 GIScience及相关领域中ABMs 的一个显著特点是，这些模型本质上具有空间性，因为代理在每一刻都存在于某个空间位置，并且可以从其位置和周围位置获取信息以决定该做什么或移动到哪里。
