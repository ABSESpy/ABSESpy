!!! tip

    If you don't have prior experience with Python, we recommend reading
    [Using Python's pip to Manage Your Projects' Dependencies], which is a
    really good introduction on the mechanics of Python package management and
    helps you troubleshoot if you run into errors.

## From source with git

Material for MkDocs can be directly used from [GitHub] by cloning the
repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you
want to use the very latest version:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ABSESpy/ABSESpy abses
```

Next, install the theme and its dependencies with:

```sh
pip install -e abses
```
