## Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)

The social-ecological systems (SES) literature now widely recognises that SES can be characterised as intertwined complex adaptive systems (CAS) ^[@biggs2021]. It means system-level patterns or behaviours cannot be explained by the individual components alone but arise from interactions among agents who adapt and learn about their environment.

Meanwhile, the conceptual foundation of agent-based modelling is complex adaptive systems theory ^[@arthur2018]. Six principles present a typology of characteristics that allows us to discern the qualities of CAS and offer suggestions on the practical implications of CAS-based approaches for assessing and applying appropriate methods to study ^[@biggs2021]:

=== "Constituted relationally"
	> Complex adaptive systems are constituted relationally, meaning that complex behaviour and structures emerge as a result of the recursive and aggregate patterns of relations between the component parts of systems.

=== "Adaptive"
	> Complex adaptive systems have adaptive capacities and self-organise and coevolve about contextual changes.

=== "Dynamic"
	> Dynamic relations characterise complex adaptive systems. In other words, the relationships in a system are constantly changing in rich and unexpected ways.

=== "Radically open"
	> Complex adaptive systems are radically open. In other words, the system's activity in relation to the environment constitutes the system itself.

=== "Contextual"
	> Complex adaptive systems are context-dependent, meaning CAS's function(s) are contingent on context.

=== "Complex causality and emergence"
	> Complex adaptive systems are characterised by complex causality and emergence. Cause-and-effect interactions in CAS are not unidirectional or linear, but are marked by complex recursive causal pathways that are non-linear and dynamic.

## Emergence (or emergent)

> [!INFO]Definition
> Since simple rules produce complex behaviour in hard-to-predict ways, the macroscopic behavior of such systems is sometimes called emergent ^[@mitchell2009].

To be more specific, there are **four types of emergencies**:

=== "Simple Emergence"
	![CleanShot2023-01-17at11.29.48@2x](https://songshgeo-picgo-1302043007.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/uPic/CleanShot%202023-01-17%20at%2011.29.48@2x.png){:style="height:130px; width:200px" align='right'}
	> Without any bottom-top feedback, each component uniquely determines the state at the next moment. This form of emergence is characterised by fragility, where the destruction of a single component can cause the system to stop working.

=== "Weak Emergence"

	> If the macro pattern can only be simulated from the micro components' dynamics, then he is weakly emergent. It can be made stable (e.g., ants foraging) or non-stable (e.g., financial markets, subordination).

=== "Multiple Emergence"

	> Both negative feedback that makes the system stable and positive feedback that makes the system non-stable. Many complex patterns are emergent as a result.

=== "Strong Emergence"

	> Emergent systems that emerge at a higher level of organisation or complexity, such as culture, language and writing systems, life, and geographic zoning...

## Human Behaviour Framework

> [!INFO]Quote
> 	> This framework allows for biases, habituation and other cognitive processes that shape human perception of climate change and the influence of social norms, social learning and other social processes on spreading information and factors that shape decision-making and behaviour ^[@beckage2022].

We applied the framework for representing human behaviour that consists of **cognition, contagion and behavioural response (CCR framework)** ^[@beckage2022]:

=== "Cognition"

	> **Cognition** represents the human processing of information around the ecological system.

=== "Contagion"

	> **Contagion** represents spreading information, beliefs and behaviour through social networks.

=== "Response"

	> **Response** is the resultant behaviour or action.

The `ABSESpy` fully embedded the three aspects of human behaviour in a different part of the model:

1. **Cognition**: developed as an essential feature of each `Actor`.
2. **Contagion**: human model can automatically [generate SEN for modelling](#TODO) this.
3. **Response**: customised by users under the [IAD framework](#TODO) ^[@ostrom2005].

Therefore, to apply this **cognition-contagion-response (CCR)** human behaviour modelling framework, users can follow [this workflow example](#TODO).
