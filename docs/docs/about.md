## What is an Agent-based Model (ABM)

> [!INFO]Definition
> An agent-based model (often referred to as **ABM**) is composed of autonomous agents, **who are diverse and interact with one another and their environment**.

ABM is simulated over time: at each [time step](#TODO) or [event](#TODO), agents take [decisions](#TODO) and act based on [their attributes](#TODO) and/or in response or anticipation of other agentsâ€™ behaviours or changes in the [environment](#TODO). The micro-level actions and interactions of many agents **give rise to macro-level patterns** and dynamics, which are typically the focus of analysis. The agents thus respond diversely to the contexts (*usually depicted by the model's parameters and variables*) they jointly created, and their actions' outcomes then lead to an emergence of the macro-pattern.

## What are Social-ecological Systems (SESs)
> [!INFO]Definition
> â€˜**Social-ecological systems**â€™ (SES) is a concept for understanding the intertwined nature of human and natural systems in an interconnected and interdependent way ^[@biggs2021].

**SESs** are not merely social plus ecological systems, but cohesive, integrated systems characterised by strong connections and feedbacks within and between social and ecological components that determine their overall dynamics ^[@folke2010]. As such, SES are a type of [complex adaptive systems](../background#complex-adaptive-systems(cas)), and studying SESs often requires the methods or the applications to cover the social domains, ecological domains, and the emergence from their dynamic interdependence ^[@folke2016].
