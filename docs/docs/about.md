## What is an Agent-based Model (ABM)

> [!INFO]Definition
> An agent-based model (often referred to as **ABM**) is composed of autonomous agents, **who are diverse and interact with one another and their environment**.

ABM is simulated over time: at each [time step](#TODO) or [event](#TODO), agents take [decisions](#TODO) and act based on [their attributes](#TODO) and/or in response or anticipation of other agentsâ€™ behaviours or changes in the [environment](#TODO). The micro-level actions and interactions of many agents **give rise to macro-level patterns** and dynamics, which are typically the focus of analysis. The agents thus adapt to the contexts they jointly create, a crucial characteristic of [complex adaptive systems](../background#complex-adaptive-systems(cas)).
