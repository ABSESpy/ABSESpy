# Structures

The overall structure of `ABSESpy` is shown in the following diagram:

![structure](https://songshgeo-picgo-1302043007.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/uPic/structure.png){width: 400px, align: center}

Three main components `BaseHuman`, `BaseNature` and `MainModel` are included. Generally, users need to write their `sub-modules` for the operation of ecosystems or the operation of social systems, as well as the behaviour of `actors`. Once the model has been developed, the `mediator` will coordinate the running of the model and output the simulation to a log. The `Experiment` helps the user run the model to perform sensitivity of specific parameters.
