`ABSESpy` makes it easier to build artificial **[Social-ecological systems](wiki/about.md#what-are-social-ecological-systems-sess)** with real **GeoSpatial datasets** and fully incorporate **human behaviour**.

- Modelling environment for agents with **[geo data](tutorial/notebooks/nature/geodata.ipynb)**: `Shapefile`, `GeoTiff`, `NetCDF`.
- Modelling **[human behaviour](tutorial/notebooks/human/CCR_example.ipynb)** of agents with [cognition, contagion and responses](wiki/background.md#human-behaviour-framework).
- Easily manage all [parameters, arguments](tutorial/notebooks/parameters.ipynb), and variables with a `yaml` settings file.

## Getting Start

The getting started guide aims to get you using `{{name}}` productively as quickly as possible. It is designed as an entry point for new users and introduces `{{name}}`â€™s main concepts.

> [!INFO]Note
> If you are unfamiliar with the social-ecological systems' framework or Agent-based modelling method, we strongly suggest you browse our [core concepts](wiki/background.md) and [tutorial](tutorial/user_guide.md) before building your model.

- {{name}} depends on several excellent open-sourced Python packages: [dependencies](home/dependencies.md)
- Installing the {{name}} package: [install](home/install.md)
- Run our testing models: [primary usage](tutorial/notebooks/model.ipynb)
- Design your model according to our [User Guide](tutorial/user_guide.md) and [API References](api/model.md)

<!-- ## Model Library

We provide several [examples](examples/negotiation.md) for reference to new users. We likewise encourage users to let us know about links to social-ecological system models/papers developed using `{{name}}`, and we will list them here. -->
