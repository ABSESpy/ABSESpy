## Features
![p50LQ2](https://songshgeo-picgo-1302043007.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/uPic/p50LQ2.jpg)

ABSESpy makes it easier to build artificial **Social-ecological systems** with real **GeoSpatial datasets** and fully incorporate **human behaviour**.

- Modelling environment for agents with **[geo data](#TODO)**: `Shapefile`, `GeoTiff`, `NetCDF`.
- Modelling human behaviour of agents with [cognition, contagion and responses](#TODO).
- Easily manage all parameters, arguments, and variables with a `yaml` settings file.
- Generate **reporting** documents, logging, and experiment reports of simulations.
- Integrated auto experiment with sensitivity analysis and basic visualisation methods.

## Getting Start

The getting started guide aims to get you using `{{name}}` productively as quickly as possible. It is designed as an entry point for new users and introduces `{{name}}`â€™s main concepts.

> [!INFO]Note
> If you are unfamiliar with the social-ecological systems' framework or Agent-based modelling method, we strongly suggest you browse our [design concepts](docs/design.md) before building your model.

- {{name}} depends on several excellent open-sourced Python packages: [dependencies](docs/dependencies.md)
- Installing the {{name}} package: [install](docs/install.md)
- Run our testing models: [primary usage](docs/usage.md)
- Design your model according to our [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md) and [API References](api/model.md)

## Model Library

We provide several [examples](examples/negotiation.md) for reference to new users. We likewise encourage users to let us know about links to social-ecological system models/papers developed using `{{name}}`, and we will list them here.
