Agent-based model (ABM) is essential for social-ecological systems (SES) research. `ABSESpy` is designed for modeling **couples humans and nature systems** by:

- [Architectural Elegance for Modular Socio-Ecological Systems Modeling](architectural_elegance.md).
- [Mastering Time in SES Modeling with Real-world Precision and Dynamic Updates](time_control.md).
- Automatically portray interactions between social actors and natural cells with `Networkx`
- By applying a [human behavior modeling framework]((https://absespy.github.io/ABSESpy/docs/background/#human-behaviour-framework)), users can define, select, and track agents of the model in more intuitive ways.
- Manage and test complex parameters [with a `yaml` file](https://absespy.github.io/ABSESpy/tutorial/notebooks/parameters/).
- access information between cells and social actors by their locations
