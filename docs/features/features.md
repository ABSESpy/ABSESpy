Agent-based model (ABM) is essential for social-ecological systems (SES) research. `ABSESpy` is designed for modeling **couples humans and nature systems** by:

- [Architectural Elegance for Modular Socio-Ecological Systems Modeling](architectural_elegance.md).
- [Mastering Time in SES Modeling with Real-world Precision and Dynamic Updates](time_control.md).
- [Unveiling Human Decision Dynamics in SES Modeling by an Advanced Human Behavior Simulating Framework.](MoHuB.md)
