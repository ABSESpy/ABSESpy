    "This introduction presents the basic structure of the package and its main components by means of building a simple model, illustrating each step of the process. The model chosen is an adaptation of the Hotelling's Law model. The counterpart written in Netlogo can be found [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Hotelling'sLaw). The Hotelling's Law, also referred to as the Law of minimum differentiation states that profit maximizing firms competing in a market with two substitute goods will settle close to each other and also lower their prices. Although the notion of distance related to space both in the original paper by Hotelling (1929) and its netlogo implementation, its definition can be expanded to other dimensions of interest."
