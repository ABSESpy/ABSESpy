    "This introduction presents the basic structure of the package and its main components by means of building a simple model, illustrating each step of the process. The model chosen is an adaptation of the Hotelling's Law model. The counterpart written in Netlogo can be found [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Hotelling'sLaw). The Hotelling's Law, also referred to as the Law of minimum differentiation states that profit maximizing firms competing in a market with two substitute goods will settle close to each other and also lower their prices. Although the notion of distance relates to space both in the original paper by Hotelling (1929) and its netlogo implementation, its definition can be expanded to other dimensions of interest."

    "Next we write the methods relating to the position adjustment schedule. Here's a detailed description of how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **adjust_position**: This method is responsible for determining the next position for the shop based on potential areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It first saves the current position of the shop in `initial_pos`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - It then gets a list of all possible moves the shop can make. This is done by calling the `get_neighborhood` method of the `major_layer` attribute of the model, which returns the neighboring cells of the shop's current position. The `major_layer` is a BaseNature instance that represent one grid of the model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For each possible move, it temporarily moves the shop to that position and calculates the potential area of the shop's monopoly if it were to move to that position. The potential area is calculated by calling the `recalculate_areas` method of the model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - It then selects the move that results in the largest potential area and stores it in `next_position`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Finally, it moves the shop back to its initial position. This is because the actual move does not occur in the `adjust_position` method. Instead, the new position is stored in `next_position` and the move is applied in the `affect_position` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **affect_position**: This method is responsible for applying the move that was determined in the `adjust_position` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It simply moves the shop to `next_position`. This is the new position that was determined in the `adjust_position` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `adjust_position` and `affect_position` methods are called in the `step` and `advance` methods of the `Shop` class, respectively. This allows all shops to make their decisions based on the current state of the model in the `step` method, and then all decisions are applied simultaneously in the `advance` method."
