    "From the previous implementation of the Hotelling model class, we already have cues as to what we should aim for and tackle. We know there must be a step and an advance method. We also know that the agent must make a decision regarding price and position based on the number of customer that prefer buying from them, thus, increasing profits and staying in business. Therefore, we will design the Shop agent class in a way that reflect this. There will be the two methods already mentioned and for each there will be two routines. \n",

At each step, each agent is going to adjust its price and position, but those changes will only take effect at a later stage. The reason for this is that we want to make sure that all agents have made their decisions before any of them takes effect. This may also be referred to as a synchronous or simultaneous update. In order to do that, we want to save the changes in a variable that will be used to update the agent's attributes at the end of the step.

It is appearently the case that more shops allow for less localised competition and, thus, higher prices in certain areas.\n",
