The potential revenue is calculated as the product of the price and the area of the shop's monopoly, which is obtained by calling the `recalculate_areas` method of the model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - If all potential revenues are 0, it sets `next_price` to be the current price minus 1. This means that if the shop cannot make any revenue at any of the possible prices, it will lower its price in the next step.\n",

    "   - If there is at least one possible price that can generate revenue, it sets `next_price` to be the one that generates the highest potential revenue.\n",

    "   - Finally, it resets the shop's price to the initial price. This is because the actual price change does not occur in the `adjust_price` method. Instead, the new price is stored in `next_price` and the price change is applied in the `affect_price` method.\n",

    "2. **affect_price**: This method is responsible for applying the price change that was determined in the `adjust_price` method.\n",

We also know that the agent must make a decision regarding price and position based on the number of customer that prefer buying from them, thus, increasing profits and staying in business. Therefore, we will design the Shop agent class in a way that reflect this. There will be the two methods already mentioned and for each there will be two routines. \n",

At each step, each agent is going to adjust its price and position, but those changes will only take effect at a later stage. The reason for this is that we want to make sure that all agents have made their decisions before any of them takes effect. This may also be referred to as a synchronous or simultaneous update. In order to do that, we want to save the changes in a variable that will be used to update the agent's attributes at the end of the step.

It is appearently the case that more shops allow for less localised competition and, thus, higher prices in certain areas.\n",
