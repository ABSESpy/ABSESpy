# Tutorial

<!-- 这里，我们提供了一系列基于Jupyter Notebook的教程，展示实际利用 ABSESpy 开发可能碰到的需求及其解决策略。 -->

Here, we provide a series of tutorials based on [Jupyter Notebook], demonstrating the potential needs and solutions when developing with `ABSESpy` in practice. We expect you have read through [Quick Start] and are sure that `ABSESpy` is [the right software for you]. Three levels of tutorials are available below:

## :hatching_chick: Beginner level

You're looking to create and operate a basic model by `ABSESpy` framework. Wondering what constitutes a "simple" model? Explore the [NetLogo model repository]; you'll find many classic yet easy-to-understand examples there.

## :horse_racing_tone1: Advanced level

You have gained a thorough understanding of the agent-based model. Now, you are not just satisfied with heuristic models[^1], you aspire to undertake a larger project to solve real-world SES problems.

## :scientist: Completing level

You have already established your own model and confirmed that it does not have major logical issues. You need help with batch experiments, data analysis, plotting, parameter sensitivity analysis, and visualization.

[^1]:
    Heuristic models are streamlined strategies used to tackle complex issues when precise formulas or solutions aren't feasible. These models rely on heuristic methods, practical tactics that may not always yield the best solution but offer a satisfactory one within an acceptable time limit.
