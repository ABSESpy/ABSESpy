    "In the dynamic realm of Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) modeling, simulating human behavior is paramount. Humans, as key actors, play a pivotal role in shaping the interactions and outcomes within SES. Recognizing the complexity and nuances of human actions, ABSESpy introduces an advanced framework to model intricate human behaviors effectively."

    "\n",
    "- Defining Interactions: Specify how agents interact with natural and social systems. This sets the stage for agents to perceive and respond to their environment.\n",
    "- Perception Modes: Define how agents perceive the world around them. Whether through direct observation, communication with other agents, or accessing stored data, `ABSESpy` supports myriad perception strategies.\n",
    "- Decision Evaluation Methods: Craft the logic behind how agents evaluate and make decisions. This can be based on predefined algorithms, heuristic methods, or machine learning models.\n",
    "- Response Mechanisms: Determine how agents respond to their decisions. This can involve moving to a new location, altering their state, or interacting with other entities.\n",

    "The beauty of ABSESpy lies in its framework that seamlessly integrates these user-defined functions, creating a smooth workflow that mirrors the intricacies of human behavior in the real world."
